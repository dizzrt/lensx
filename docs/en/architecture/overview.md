# Architecture Overview

## Document Status

This document defines the maintained architectural direction for lensX and
records the foundation currently present in the repository. Architectural
direction is not evidence that a capability is shipped; source code, tests, and
stable specs determine implemented behavior.

## Product Purpose

lensX is a lightweight desktop productivity launcher. It is designed around:

- fast global activation;
- keyboard-first interaction;
- low resident resource use;
- local-first workflows;
- explicit, safe extension boundaries;
- predictable behavior across supported desktop platforms.

## Current Foundation

The repository currently provides:

- a Tauri 2 desktop application runtime backed by Rust;
- a React and TypeScript frontend built with Rsbuild and Rspack;
- Semi Design, UnoCSS, and Less as the frontend UI and styling foundation;
- a product-owned React App Shell with unified locale, theme, Semi Design, and
  render-error boundaries;
- Rstest, Testing Library, TypeScript checks, Biome, and Cargo validation
  commands;
- OpenSpec configuration for capability and architecture changes.

Product capabilities beyond this foundation must not be described as
implemented until their source code and tests exist.

## Frontend Application Foundation

`src/index.tsx` is the only frontend composition entry. It imports the Semi
Design global stylesheet and the project `global.less` entry once, then renders
the product App Shell inside `AppProviders`.

`AppProviders` is the single application-level provider composition:

```text
AppLocaleProvider
└── AppThemeProvider
    └── Semi Design LocaleProvider
        └── AppErrorBoundary
            └── App
```

The application locale is limited to `en-US` and `zh-CN`, defaults to `en-US`,
and drives application messages, the corresponding official Semi Design locale
pack, and the HTML `lang` attribute. English messages are canonical, and both
message resources keep the same nested hierarchy and leaf-key set. Statically
imported resources live in `src/app/i18n/messages/en-US.json` and `zh-CN.json`;
application lookups address their leaves with dot-separated paths. A shared
`messages.schema.json` mirrors the hierarchy, fixes the allowed and required
keys, rejects additional keys, and requires non-empty string values. Frontend
tests validate every locale against that schema and compare complete leaf-key
sets. Locale selection is currently in-memory only and does not follow an
operating-system preference.

The application theme is limited to `light` and `dark` and defaults to
`light`. The theme provider uses `body[theme-mode="dark"]` so Semi Design
content mounted under `body`, including overlays, receives the same token set.
It also synchronizes the document `color-scheme`. Theme selection is currently
in-memory only and does not follow an operating-system preference.

`AppErrorBoundary` isolates render failures below the provider root. Its
localized Semi Design fallback preserves the current theme and offers a window
reload action without displaying exception details. Event-handler and
asynchronous errors require explicit error states and are outside this render
boundary.

The current App Shell deliberately exposes only the lensX identity and product
description. It is an observable foundation, not evidence that launcher,
settings, or plugin workflows are implemented.

## Layered Model

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ React presentation                         │
│ screens, interaction state, view composition│
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Application and domain services             │
│ launcher concepts, orchestration, contracts │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Typed desktop adapters                      │
│ serializable Tauri commands and events      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Rust desktop runtime                        │
│ native integration, persistence, privilege  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Extension runtimes connect through explicit Host contracts. They do not bypass
application services to access React state, Tauri internals, or privileged
native APIs.

## Responsibility Boundaries

### React Frontend

The frontend owns:

- presentation and view composition;
- transient interaction state;
- keyboard and focus behavior within the application surface;
- theme and locale presentation;
- calls through typed application and desktop adapters.

Business rules should remain independent of React components whenever they can
be expressed as testable domain functions or services.

### Rust Desktop Runtime

Rust owns:

- native window and operating-system integration;
- privileged operations and security-sensitive validation;
- persistence and filesystem boundaries;
- performance-sensitive background work;
- stable Tauri commands and events.

Rust must not leak internal implementation types across the Tauri boundary.

### Cross-Boundary Contracts

Frontend, Rust, and extension boundaries must use payloads that are:

- explicitly typed;
- serializable;
- validated at trust boundaries;
- versioned when external consumers depend on them;
- stable enough to test independently.

Use `snake_case` for serialized cross-language fields unless an accepted
contract specifies otherwise.

## Dependency Direction

- UI components may depend on application services, not directly on Rust
  internals.
- Application services may depend on abstract adapters and domain contracts.
- Tauri adapters translate between application contracts and native commands.
- Native services must not depend on frontend component structure.
- Extension contracts must not depend on private React modules.

Avoid parallel sources of truth for locale, theme, persisted preferences, or
registered capabilities.

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

- English is the default application locale; Simplified Chinese is also
  supported.
- Light and dark modes use the supported Semi Design theming mechanism.
- Keyboard access and visible focus are first-class requirements.
- Errors crossing boundaries must be diagnosable and safe to display or log.
- Planned behavior must pass through OpenSpec before becoming a stable
  capability contract.
