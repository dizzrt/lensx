# Architecture Overview

## Document Status

This document defines the maintained architectural direction for lensX and
records the foundation currently present in the repository. Architectural
direction is not evidence that a capability is shipped; source code, tests, and
stable specs determine implemented behavior.

## Product Purpose

lensX is a lightweight desktop productivity launcher. It is designed around:

- fast global activation;
- keyboard-first interaction;
- low resident resource use;
- local-first workflows;
- explicit, safe extension boundaries;
- predictable behavior across supported desktop platforms.

## Current Foundation

The repository currently provides:

- a Tauri 2 desktop application scaffold backed by Rust;
- a React and TypeScript frontend built with Rsbuild and Rspack;
- Semi Design, UnoCSS, and Less as the frontend UI and styling foundation;
- Rstest, Testing Library, TypeScript checks, Biome, and Cargo validation
  commands;
- OpenSpec configuration for capability and architecture changes.

Product capabilities beyond this foundation must not be described as
implemented until their source code and tests exist.

## Layered Model

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ React presentation                         │
│ screens, interaction state, view composition│
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Application and domain services             │
│ launcher concepts, orchestration, contracts │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Typed desktop adapters                      │
│ serializable Tauri commands and events      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Rust desktop runtime                        │
│ native integration, persistence, privilege  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Extension runtimes connect through explicit Host contracts. They do not bypass
application services to access React state, Tauri internals, or privileged
native APIs.

## Responsibility Boundaries

### React Frontend

The frontend owns:

- presentation and view composition;
- transient interaction state;
- keyboard and focus behavior within the application surface;
- theme and locale presentation;
- calls through typed application and desktop adapters.

Business rules should remain independent of React components whenever they can
be expressed as testable domain functions or services.

### Rust Desktop Runtime

Rust owns:

- native window and operating-system integration;
- privileged operations and security-sensitive validation;
- persistence and filesystem boundaries;
- performance-sensitive background work;
- stable Tauri commands and events.

Rust must not leak internal implementation types across the Tauri boundary.

### Cross-Boundary Contracts

Frontend, Rust, and extension boundaries must use payloads that are:

- explicitly typed;
- serializable;
- validated at trust boundaries;
- versioned when external consumers depend on them;
- stable enough to test independently.

Use `snake_case` for serialized cross-language fields unless an accepted
contract specifies otherwise.

## Dependency Direction

- UI components may depend on application services, not directly on Rust
  internals.
- Application services may depend on abstract adapters and domain contracts.
- Tauri adapters translate between application contracts and native commands.
- Native services must not depend on frontend component structure.
- Extension contracts must not depend on private React modules.

Avoid parallel sources of truth for locale, theme, persisted preferences, or
registered capabilities.

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

- English is the default application locale; Simplified Chinese is also
  supported.
- Light and dark modes use the supported Semi Design theming mechanism.
- Keyboard access and visible focus are first-class requirements.
- Errors crossing boundaries must be diagnosable and safe to display or log.
- Planned behavior must pass through OpenSpec before becoming a stable
  capability contract.
